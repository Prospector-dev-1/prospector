Analyze this cold calling transcript and provide scores (1-10) for each category. The caller was trying to sell a website to a business owner.

IMPORTANT: Only analyze and score if the CALLER (salesperson) actually spoke and made a sales pitch. If the transcript shows only the prospect speaking or very minimal caller participation, return all scores as 0 and indicate insufficient data.

Transcript:
${transcript}

Please analyze WHO is speaking in this transcript:
- The CALLER (salesperson) - this is who we're evaluating
- The PROSPECT (business owner) - this is who the caller is trying to sell to

If the caller didn't make a meaningful sales attempt (less than 20 words of sales content), return all scores as 0 with feedback explaining insufficient sales attempt.

If there IS a meaningful sales conversation from the caller, provide scores and brief feedback for:
1. ‚ùì Objection Handling (objection_handling_score) - Did they turn around the objection or ignore it?
2. üß† Confidence (confidence_score) - Was their tone assertive or hesitant?
3. üéØ Clarity (clarity_score) - Was their message focused?
4. üí° Persuasion (persuasiveness_score) - Did they appeal emotionally or logically?
5. üëÇ Listening & Response (tone_score) - Did they tailor answers or script-dump?
6. üìã Overall Pitch / Script (overall_pitch_score) - How well structured and delivered was their overall pitch?
7. Closing Ability (closing_score) - How effectively did they attempt to close or advance the sale?
8. Sale Success - Did the prospect agree to buy, schedule a meeting, or show strong interest? (true/false)
